    Scheduled_Save_Interval: 20
    # Sets scheduled save delay (in seconds) for a user when marked to be saved.
    # This means that a user will be saved X seconds later after being marked.
    # Generally, you should keep this value less than 'Scheduled_Save_Interval' for best results,
    # and not setting it extremely high, otherwise you may result in user data never saved & synchronized.
    #
    # IMPORTANT NOTE #1: When a user is marked for saving, this will prevent them from syncing until saving occurs!
    # IMPORTANT NOTE #2: Every time a user is marked for saving, their save time will be updated with this value!

    # Sets synchronization delay (in seconds) before the plugin can continue syncing data for a user after its scheduled save.
    # When a user marked for saving has been saved, their synchronization will be unlocked but delayed for this value.
