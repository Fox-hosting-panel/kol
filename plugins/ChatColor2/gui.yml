# GUI Config Format Guide

# NOTE: All materials must be 1.16 materials. They will be automatically
#       converted into other versions materials.

#       See here for 1.16:

# NOTE: COLOR items represent a color, MODIFIER items represent a modifier
#       and INVENTORY items link to another inventory.
#
# NOTE: All inventory-related messages can be used as a placeholder, like
#       %gui-available%.
#
# NOTE: color-unavailable, modifier-unavailable, modifier-inactive, modifier-active
#       can all be left out if not needed.
